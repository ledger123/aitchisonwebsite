							  <h3>Re: Boarders: Visitors and the Granting of Leave</h3>
						  </div>
						  <br />
						  <div style="text-align: justify;">
						   

						   <p>Boarders reside at the College as a  community in term time. Aitchison is responsible for their education, safety  and upbringing.&nbsp; Boarders must be present  during term time to benefit from our programme. This is to ensure that the  community remains intact, is not continually interrupted, and remains focused  on learning, sport, activities and social opportunities. The random coming and  going of boys (and visitors) is not conducive to the good order of a boarding  community.                       </p>
						   <p>All boarders are treated equally, by which we mean that all may receive visitors <strong>twice a month</strong> on the second <strong>Sunday</strong> and the last weekend of each month. Visitors will see or collect boys from the “Old Building” set up for that purpose. Visiting rules  apply irrespective of where a family lives. Visiting times are between 10am and  5pm Saturday and Sunday, but always after sporting commitments or house duties.  Boys must obtain permission to opt out of these commitments from their  Housemaster or Housemistress. In the case of sport the Games Master will liaise  with the House. <strong>Boys cannot leave teams  without permission. </strong>&nbsp;</p>
						  <p><strong>Exceptional  Leave</strong> may be granted by  housemasters and housemistress for overnight exeats or leave during term time,  but the Head of School is to be notified (in all cases) and sign off for  approval. An afternoon leave can be approved by the Housemaster or  Housemistress without such referral and when the boy has no commitments. The usual  valid reasons for Exceptional Leave would be:</p>
						  <ol>
							<li>Important family  occasion such as a wedding or birthday </li>
							<li>Medical  appointments</li>
							<li>Bereavement</li>
							<li>Emergency</li>
						  </ol>
						  <p><strong>No  leave is granted during examination study leave or during examinations without  the Head of School’s approval. Only extreme circumstances would justify this. </strong><br>
							<strong>Leave  in excess of one night or one school day away will require the additional signed  approval of the Principal.</strong> <strong>Regardless, boys must first apply for leave  through their housemaster or housemistress. Emails to the Principal or his  office will be ignored. All boys must follow the chain of command. </strong></p>
						  <p>An appropriate leave form will be  signed by all parties. It is crucial that parents also verbally approve boys’  overnight leave requests (not afternoon) and we know who is collecting and  returning the boy or alternatively what the travel arrangements are.</p>
						  <p>All leave is recorded in the House  Leave Register on exit and return. <strong>Boys  who break the conditions of leave may have further leave denied. Any extension of  leave must gain approval through the appropriate channels. </strong></p>
						  <p><strong>Random  visitors are not permitted in the Board Houses or immediate areas.</strong> Security will check with the Housemaster or  Housemistress if such visits arrive at the Gate and ascertain if they have  received authorized approval from the Housemaster or Housemistress. A ‘drop  off’ item is not a way of visiting. Items may be delivered to the House by  security. Again, we apply equal conditions to all boarders. </p>
						  <p>It is absolutely crucial that boarders  know these rules. Making this clear will help everyone involved. Weekly  boarders follow the same rules, except for weekends where they are not here. No  weekly boarder may stay over the weekend without first obtaining permission  from the Housemaster or Housemistress. </p>
