Kamini

The "Kamini Tree" is often associated with the fragrant flowering tree scientifically known as Murraya paniculata, but it is also known by several common names, including "Kamini," "Orange Jasmine," "Mock Orange," or "Satinwood." 

Murraya paniculata is an evergreen shrub or small tree that can reach heights of 3 to 7 meters (10 to 23 feet). It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves, which are pinnately compound with lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, white, highly fragrant flowers.

One of the most attractive features of the Kamini tree is its fragrant flowers. The blossoms are white, often with a hint of cream or yellow, and they emit a sweet, citrusy fragrance, especially in the evening. This fragrance is particularly appealing and is reminiscent of orange blossoms.
