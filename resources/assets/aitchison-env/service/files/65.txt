Kigelia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. The genus consists of only one species, Kigelia africana, which occurs throughout tropical Africa. The so-called sausage tree grows a poisonous fruit that is up to 60 cm long, weighs about 7 kg, and resembles a sausage in a casing. 

With the ability to purify the skin while reducing the effects of damage and aging, Kigelia's natural power soothes and rejuvenates the skin. It has even been used to help skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis and contains amino acids and many other essential nutrients to support skin health.
