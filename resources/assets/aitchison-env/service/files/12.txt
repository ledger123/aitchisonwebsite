Bottlebrush

Callistemon is a genus of shrubs in the family Myrtaceae, first described as a genus in 1814. The entire genus is endemic to Australia but widely cultivated in many other regions and naturalized in scattered locations.

Callistemon species have commonly been referred to as Bottlebrushes because of their cylindrical, brush like flowers resembling a traditional bottle brush.

To get the most beautiful blooms, plant Bottlebrush in a location with full sun exposure. Full sun is at least six hours of direct sunlight each day. Once established, these plants can tolerate drought. They prefer soil that is moist but well-drained.
