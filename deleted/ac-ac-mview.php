            <br /><br />
            <p>Aitchison College is an accredited Cambridge School and Cambridge Examination Centre. We are committed to an academic programme that challenges boys and prepares them for seamless transition between year levels and across all our three schools: Junior, Prep and Senior. All teaching is shaped by subject departments led by well qualified and highly experienced heads who are assisted by a Cambridge Coordinator or Academic Coordinator reporting to the particular Head of School. The Principal carries overall responsibility for the quality and direction of Academics, but all initial academic concerns or queries should, first, be directed to the relevant school. Aitchison offers a strong international component in all teaching and learning. We drive learning through creative, activity based classes, in which concepts underpin knowledge acquisition and application. Aitchison is preparing the leaders of tomorrow. </p>
            <p><br>
              Academic achievement is celebrated with the awarding of prizes and other forms of recognition in special assemblies, and at Founders’ Day. Academic life is not restricted to the classroom; societies and enrichment programmes fulfill the spirit of Aitchison’s broad intellectual life. Curiosity is well-supported by libraries in each of the three schools and the College’s main library the <em>Sayed Babar Ali Library</em>. There is also an extensive E Book collection. </p>
            <p><br>
              Every child matters to us and we pride ourselves on being proactive in supporting learning outcomes. The success of our Academic life is reflected in the remarkably strong placement of graduating students in <a href="ac-university-placements.php"><span style="color: #000099">foreign as well as national universities of distinction</span>.</a>
