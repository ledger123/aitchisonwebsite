BIGNONIA GRANDIFLORA

Deciduous climber that can reach 5-6 m tall. Flowers with a calyx bell pulling orange to red. Flowering: summer and autumn. Sun Exposure: Full sun or partial shade.

It is grown primarily for its attractive flowers and its ability to rapidly cover structures with attractive foliage. Opposite, compound leaves are bifoliate. Each leaf consists of a pair of lanceolate to oblong dark green leaflets (to 6‚Äù long) and a branched tendril between them.

It is very common to use Begonias to cover walls, fences, pergolas, or even rocky ground surfaces. Many gardeners or plant enthusiasts create colourful plant fences by combining Bignonia (bright orange flowers) with plumbago (flowers in sea colour) and bougainvillaea (pink, red and white flowers).
