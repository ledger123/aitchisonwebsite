Weeping Willow

Unlike other trees, Willows can be as wide as they are tall. Weeping Willow trees are famed for their dramatic, elegant appearance. Their long, graceful branches “weep” into an arch, creating a round canopy that grazes the ground gently. Their narrow leaves are light green on top, with silvery undersides until they turn yellow in autumn. The bark is rough, gray, and ridged.

The Weeping Willow produces catkins, which are long, slender, and drooping clusters of small flowers. These catkins appear in early spring before the leaves emerge and are a vital source of pollen for bees and other early pollinators.

The trees are used to treat mastitis, toothaches, and scalds. The plant has a much longer history in native China. There, the bark has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, fevers, and jaundice; the leaves have been used in treating fevers, skin eruptions, and to purify the blood.
