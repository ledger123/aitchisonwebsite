Sukh Chain

Pongamia glabra, commonly known as Indian Beech or Sukh Chain, is a medium-sized, evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Fabaceae family.

Pongamia glabra typically reaches heights of 15 to 25 meters (50 to 80 feet) and has a rounded crown. It has compound leaves with several pairs of leaflets that are elliptical or lance-shaped.

The tree produces fragrant, pea-like flowers that can be white, pink, or purple, depending on the variety. These flowers are attractive to pollinators like bees.

After flowering, Pongamia glabra produces long, woody, and indehiscent pods (legumes) that contain seeds. These seeds are sometimes referred to as "Karanga" seeds and are the most notable part of the tree for their various uses.

Pongamia glabra is native to a wide range of regions in the Indian subcontinent, including India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and other neighboring countries. It is often found near riverbanks and in coastal areas.
