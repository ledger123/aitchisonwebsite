PONYTAIL PALM

Ponytail Palms grow less than one foot per year. When mature, they can reach an average height of 12 to 18 feet—and in tropical climates, these trees can grow up to 30 feet tall. The distinctive, fat trunk base stores water, allowing the tree to survive during drought conditions.

The Ponytail Palm is normally seen as an ornamental plant that can reach up to 10 feet indoors. It is also very easy to maintain and is drought-tolerant due to its succulent qualities. The plant is also known for filtering out harmful toxins, adding fresh air to your home, and being safe for pets.

The Ponytail Palm (Beaucarnea recurvata) is also called elephant's foot – and for good reason: With its thick trunk tapering upward, it actually looks like the stompers of the docile savanna animals. But not only this unusual appearance makes it a popular houseplant.
