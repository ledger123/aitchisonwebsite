
MIMOSA PUDICA

A prickly, long-lived (perennial), herbaceous plant or small shrub with a creeping (prostrate or decumbent) or sprawling habit. It usually only grows 15-50 cm tall, but can reach up to 1 m or more in height when supported by other vegetation.

Mimosa pudica earned its nickname "sensitive plant" from its reaction to stimulation. Its leaflets quickly turn inward when touched or shaken. The reason is up for debate. One explanation is that it is a form of predatory defense, exposing the thorn-covered stems.
