Fan Palm

With its beauty and cold hardiness, the Fan Palm (Livistona chinensis) is primarily grown for its ornamental value. Its wood has, however, been used for centuries in China to make umbrella handles and walking sticks. Due to their astringent nature, phenolic compounds in seeds and fruits also have antibacterial properties.

It is native to southern Japan, Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, southeastern China, and Hainan. In Japan, two notable populations occupy islands near the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture, Aoshima and Tsuki Shima.

European fan palms thrive in full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade as well. Choose a location where your palm will receive at least four to six hours of direct sunlight on most days. Too much shade can cause the palm to get leggy.
