							<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

							<p>Aitchison College provides computers in all schools for use in studies, as an extension to the College library, and as a support to the curriculum.&nbsp; Users are responsible for the appropriate use of computers including use of the Internet.

								<li>Computer storage areas and floppy disks will be treated like school desks.&nbsp; Staff may review files and communications to ensure that users are using the system responsibly.</li>

								<li>Respect the work and ownership rights of people outside the school, as well as other pupils or staff.&nbsp; This includes abiding by copyright laws.</li>
								<li>&lsquo;Chat&rsquo; activities over the Internet are forbidden. This takes up valuable resources which could be used by others to benefit their studies.</li>
								
							</ul>

							<ul>
								<li>Searching, viewing or retrieving materials that are not related to the aims of the curriculum.</li>
								<li>Copying, saving or redistributing copyright-protected material, without approval.</li>
								<li>Subscribing to any services or ordering goods or services, unless specifically approved by the College.</li>
								<li>Playing computer games or using other interactive &lsquo;chat&rsquo; or &lsquo;social&rsquo; sites unless specifically approved by the College.</li>
								<li>Using the network in such a way that use of the network by other users is disrupted (for example: downloading large files during peak usage times; sending mass email messages).</li>
								<li>Publishing, sharing or distributing any personal information about a user (such as: home address; email address; phone number; etc.).</li>
								<li>Downloading software.</li>

							</ul>
								
							<p><strong>Software Piracy</strong></p>
							
							<p>The college forbids the unauthorized duplication or use of copyrighted software. It is illegal to copy commercial software for your own use or by others. Likewise, knowingly accepting or using copies of "pirated" software violates the policy of Aitchison College.</p>

							<p><strong>Enforcement</strong></p>

							<p>If a user violates these provisions, access to the Internet will be denied and disciplinary action will be taken. For serious violations, suspension or expulsion may be imposed.</p>

							<p><strong>Acceptable use of Internet and email facilities for children and staff rationale</strong></p>

							<p>Aitchison College has the opportunity to transform and enhance education and help children to fulfil their potential and raise standards with ICT. However, we also have a duty of care and must ensure that we are able to safeguard children and staff, so it is also important that children learn how to be safe when they are using new technologies.&nbsp; Whilst blocking and banning is part of our policy, we believe a more sustainable approach is required. We will equip the children with the skills and knowledge they need to use the Internet safely and responsibly, managing the risks wherever and whenever they go online; to promote safe and responsible behaviours in using technology both at school and in the home and beyond.</p>
