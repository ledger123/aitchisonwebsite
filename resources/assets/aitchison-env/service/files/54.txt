KANER / PEELI KANER

Kaner is an evergreen tropical shrub or small tree. Its leaves are willow-like, linear-lanceolate, and glossy green in colour. They are covered in the waxy coating to reduce water loss (typical of oleanders). Its stem is green turning silver/gray as it ages.

Kaner is used in making medicines for leprosy, inflammation, wound, heart, etc. Kaner leaves also have medicinal properties, just like their flowers. People usually make a paste from its leaves and apply it on pain, often using it in wounds and herpes-itching
