RUBBER PLANT

Rubber plants are grown for their glossy, leathery, large leaves. The leaves are oblong to oval, 8 to 12 inches long and in various colours of dark green, deep maroon or marked with yellow, cream, pink or white. The Tricolor rubber plant (Ficus elastica 'Tricolor') has attractive green, cream and pink splotched leaves.

It also has air purification properties. Moreover the rubber plant has very thick broad leaves with a large surface area. It is also a common house plant and easy to propogate

The Ficus elastica's family, Moraceae, is a family of shrubs, trees, and lianas; they are known for bleeding a latexy sap upon wounding, and exhibiting “foliar polymorphisms.” This means that their leaf shapes will be different for different stages of life, which is a unique and special feature.
