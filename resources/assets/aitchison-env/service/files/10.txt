
SHAHTOOT / MULBERRY


Mulberries are fast-growing when young, but soon become slow-growing. The Mulberry tree has a spreading habit and becomes crooked and gnarled with time, making architectural features. It has attractive leaves. Immature fruits are white, green, or pale yellow.

Mulberry (Shahtoot) is rich in Vitamin A, vitamin E, and carotenoids, and these have potential antioxidant properties. It may help in reducing the appearance of scars, keeps the skin smooth and young, and reduces age spots due to these antioxidant properties.

The Persian Mulberry tree, also known as the Shahtoot, produces very delicious, dark red, wide, juicy fruits with a very pleasant sour and sweet flavor when ripe. The fruit itself turns almost into a black shade resembling a blackberry. However, the taste, texture, and the plant's growth habits are very different.
