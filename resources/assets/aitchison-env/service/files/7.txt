Amltas

"Amaltas" is the common name for the Cassia fistula Tree, which is also known as the Golden Shower Tree. This tree is native to the Indian subcontinent and is renowned for its striking clusters of bright yellow, pendulous flowers, which resemble showers of gold, especially when in full bloom. 

Cassia fistula is a medium-sized deciduous tree that can grow up to 15-20 meters in height. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The most distinctive feature of the Amaltas tree is its long, drooping flower clusters that can reach up to 60 centimeters in length. These flowers give the tree its common name, "Golden Shower."

The Amaltas tree typically blooms during the spring season, and its striking yellow flowers make it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and public spaces. The flowers are followed by the development of long, cylindrical pods that contain numerous seeds. These pods can be up to 60 centimeters in length and have a woody texture.
