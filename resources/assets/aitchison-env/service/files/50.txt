Jacaranda mimosifolia

Jacaranda mimosifolia is a sub-tropical tree native to south-central South America that has been widely planted elsewhere because of its attractive and long-lasting violet-colored flowers. It is also known as the jacaranda, blue jacaranda, black pouch, Nupur, or fern tree.

It is a deciduous tree that grows 25-50' tall in its native habitat. In tropical and subtropical climates, it puts on a spectacular flowering display in spring to summer wherein blue-purple flowers cover the tree with bloom, forming pools of blue on the ground as they fall.

The tree is used to treat hepatitis. In folk tradition, the flowers, leaves, and bark are used to ease neuralgia and varicose veins. Hot Jacaranda leaf baths treat wounds and skin infections. The tree also helps in the treatment of acne.
