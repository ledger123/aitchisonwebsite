There are more than 3,000 varieties of pears but the most common are Bartlett, Anjou, Bosc and Comice pears.

Its leaves are alternate and oval with a pointed tip and toothed edges. The fruit of Pear trees is eaten by a range of birds. Pear tree flowers are white and appear in clusters. Pear trees are native to southern, western and central Europe.

The Pear tree is known to live a long life and produces an abundance of fruit for decades. This is perhaps why the Chinese believe that the pear is a symbol of immortality and it can be found in many tapestries and prints over the centuries.

Pear fruit and the bark and leaves of the pear tree are used to prepare a decoction, which is full of dietary fibre. This might act as a gentle laxative that might help regulate bowel movements and help combat constipation.
