Fiddle-Leaf Fig

Ficus lyrata, commonly known as the Fiddle-Leaf Fig, is a species of flowering plant in the mulberry and fig family Moraceae. It is native to western Africa, from Cameroon west to Sierra Leone, where it grows in lowland tropical rainforest. It can grow up to 12â€“15 m tall. 

Many houseplants can help improve the air in your home, but the Ficus Lyrata is an air-purifying house plant like no other. A NASA survey found that the Fiddle Leaf Fig can purify the air well enough that it has been considered for use in a space shuttle.

It's the only place where you'll find the species of wasp required for the plant's reproduction.
