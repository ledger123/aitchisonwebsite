Citrus jambhiri

Citrus jambhiri, commonly known as Rough Lemon or Citron Lemon, is a citrus tree species believed to have originated in northern India or northeastern India. It is a close relative of the more commonly known lemon (Citrus limon) and is cultivated in various subtropical regions around the world.

The primary use of Citrus jambhiri is for its fruit. The fruit, known as "Rough Lemon," is smaller than typical lemons and is characterized by its rough, bumpy skin. Despite its unattractive appearance, the fruit is prized for its tart and acidic juice, which is used in culinary applications, including flavoring dishes, making beverages, and as a condiment. It's also utilized in the production of marmalades and preserves.

Additionally, Citrus jambhiri, like other citrus species, provides several health benefits. Its fruit is a good source of vitamin C and antioxidants, which contribute to a healthy diet and can boost the immune system. The essential oils extracted from the fruit's peel are used in perfumery and aromatherapy.

Cultivating Citrus jambhiri can have environmental benefits as well. Its deep roots help prevent soil erosion, and the tree provides habitat and sustenance for various wildlife, including birds and insects. Moreover, its fragrant blossoms attract pollinators, benefiting local biodiversity and aiding in the pollination of other plants.
