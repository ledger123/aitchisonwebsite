Maulsri

Maulsri is a common name for the tree scientifically known as Madhuca longifolia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae. 

The Maulsari tree is a medium to large-sized evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 20 to 25 meters (about 65 to 82 feet). It has simple, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant, yellow or creamy-white flowers.

Maulsari trees are native to the Indian subcontinent and are found in various regions of India, as well as in parts of Southeast Asia. They prefer tropical and subtropical climates.

The tree produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellowish-white and fragrant. These flowers are a source of nectar for pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The tree also bears oval to ellipsoid fruits with a hard outer shell and a single large seed inside. The fruit pulp is edible but not commonly consumed.
