            <p>Aitchison College offers places each year for international students with preference given to those entering O Levels/IGCSE to A Levels within its <a href="boarding-houses" target="_blank" class="custom">boarding community</a>. This offer would best suit foreign or expatriate families with cultural attachments to Pakistan, eager for their sons to acquaint themselves with family, heritage or language, while receiving a top international education. Boarders enjoy the beauty of one the world’s most outstanding educational environments. Occasionally, we consider places in younger year levels.</p>

                <p>As a school renowned world-wide for excellence in residential education, our facilities, systems and educational support are impressive. Aitchison College has been a Cambridge Examination Centre since 1935 – the only school-based centre in the country. Our academic results are impressive with a high proportion of boys gaining admission to <a href="<?php echo $path;?>school/university-placements" target="_blank" class="custom">top universities</a> in the USA, UK, Canada, Germany and Holland, and here also in Pakistan. Among the typical undergraduate courses are: Medicine, Engineering, Law, IT and Programing, Marketing, Economics and Business. Underpinning these outcomes is Aitchison’s own <a href="<?php echo $path;?>school/university-counseling" target="_blank" class="custom">University Guidance Department</a> that helps with career and admissions advice, SAT and ACT preparations, and general applications to universities, including UCAS and individual US and other foreign colleges. Aitchison is also a SAT Centre registered under the US College Board.

                <p class="mt-2">Our educational program is broad and engaging offering many <a href="<?php echo $path;?>sports/sports" target="_blank" class="custom">sports</a> and <a href="<?php echo $path;?>schools/clubs-and-societies" target="_blank" class="custom">co-curricular activities</a>, including the <a href="<?php echo $path;?>principal-letter-36-aitchison-to-offer-duke-of-edinburgh-international-award" target="_blank" class="custom">Duke of Edinburgh International Award</a>. As such, boarders pursue a balanced and busy school life that includes time for social activities, special house dinners, as well as excursions into the Old City and the surrounds of Lahore, on some weekends. Northern trekking camps are held in June/July. Our sporting teams travel overseas on tours to the United Kingdom, India, Middle East and Australia. Of particular note, Aitchison has one of the best <a href="<?php echo $path;?>sports/riding" target="_blank" class="custom">riding programs</a> in the world. Tent Pegging, Arena Polo, Dressage and Show Jumping are featured events. Older boys may also learn to ride as part of their education under the watchful eyes of trained horsemen.</p>
                <p>Aitchison has an Australian Principal supported most ably by a Senior Head, highly experienced academic staff and boarding housemasters. All classes are conducted in English and the classroom experience is interactive and explorative, with seniors engaging in the Harkness Table and a unique Meta Cognition Curriculum aimed at extending boys’ learning and thinking as part of their journey toward post schooling life. The Aitchison international boarding fee is well below other comparable international options.</p>

                <p class="mt-2">Boarding is the true way to experience Aitchison College. Each of our senior houses has beautifully appointed common rooms and very pleasant sleeping quarters, each with adjoining washrooms and private study facilities. Expert teachers in all subjects are on hand to ensure that academic needs are met promptly. Boarders at Aitchison uphold the traditions of the original Chiefs’ College, wearing white salwar kameez in summer and black sherwani in winter. Boys from Aitchison are groomed to be gentlemen; confident, compassionate, objective and determined</p>

                <h3>Entrance Requirements</h3>
                <p>Aitchison College is a selective school by testing and interview. International boys will need to produce verifiably strong academic results submitted on an official school or examination council transcript. Our Academic Office will then contact the candidate’s school. Interviews may be conducted on skype with the Principal. Parents considering this option are welcome to call the College or arrange a visit. A visit to our website is also advisable. By definition an international student is a boy who has been exclusively educated outside Pakistan.</p>
