                    <p>Prep School is an inspiring environment for boys who are quickly maturing and eager to express opinions. We aim to set our boys on the path toward being lifelong learners with inquisitive, objective minds. We emphasise mastery of subjects and a strong basis in knowledge and concepts from which to launch into senior studies. Equally, we strive to instill the values of an ethical person; a young gentleman -&nbsp;<em>an Aitchisonian</em>.</p>
