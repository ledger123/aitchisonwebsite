Bargad

"Bargad" is a term commonly used in India for the Banyan tree, scientifically known as Ficus benghalensis. The Banyan tree is a large and iconic species native to the Indian subcontinent and other parts of Southeast Asia. It is renowned for its grandeur, with an extensive canopy and characteristic aerial roots that grow from its branches and reach the ground. 

The Banyan tree is one of the largest trees in terms of canopy coverage. It can reach heights of up to 20 to 30 meters (65 to 100 feet) or more. Its leaves are elliptical and dark green, and it produces small, round figs that are typically green when unripe and turn purple when ripe.

One of the most distinctive features of the Banyan tree is its aerial roots. These roots grow from the branches and eventually reach the ground, where they take root and become secondary trunks. This unique growth pattern gives the tree a majestic and awe-inspiring appearance.
