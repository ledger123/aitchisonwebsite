
AUSTRALIS

Australis varies by region in its natural range. Some variants have MƒÅori names. It grows up to 20 metres (66 feet) tall with a stout trunk and sword-like leaves, which are clustered at the tips of the branches and can be up to 1 metre (3 feet 3 inches) long.

The tree was used as a source of food, particularly in the South Island, where it was cultivated in areas where other crops would not grow. It provided durable fibre for textiles, anchor ropes, fishing lines, baskets, waterproof rain capes and cloaks, and sandals.

Agathis australis is easily recognized by its massive unbranched columnar trunk with stout branches at the top. Younger trees have whorled branches with thick and leathery, linear-oblong leaves. Seed cones are woody and disintegrate on the tree to release winged seeds.
