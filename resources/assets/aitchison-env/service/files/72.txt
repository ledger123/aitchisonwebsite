KHAJOOR / DATE PALM

The Date Palm grows about 23 m tall. Its stem, strongly marked with the pruned stubs of old leaf bases, terminates in a crown of graceful, shining, pinnate leaves about 5 m long. Floral spikes branch from the axils of leaves that emerged the previous year.

Its trunk furnishes timber; the midribs of the leaves supply material for crates and furniture; the leaflets, for basketry; the leaf bases, for fuel; the fruit stalks, for rope and fuel; the fibre, for cordage and packing material; and the seeds are sometimes ground and used as stock feed.

The oil from the fruit of certain palm trees has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. Palm tree oil is said to have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. It's also been used to treat skin conditions like psoriasis and eczema.

Dates were probably cultivated about 8,000 years ago in present-day Iraq. Date Palm trees need at least 100 days of 100ÂºF heat and plenty of water to produce the best quality fruit. There are so many different types of date fruit.
