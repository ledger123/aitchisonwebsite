CITRUS LIMETTA

limetta is a small tree up to 8 m (26 ft) in height, with irregular branches and relatively smooth, brownish-grey bark. It has numerous thorns, 15–75 mm (0.59–2.95 in) long. The petioles are narrowly but distinctly winged, and are 8–29 mm (0.31–1.14 in) long.

Like most citrus, the fruit is rich in vitamin C, providing 50 mg per 100 g serving and antioxidants. In Iran it is popular as a house remedy to treat influenza and the common cold. The tree is used for ornamental purposes as well as for graft stock.
