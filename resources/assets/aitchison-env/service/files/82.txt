Overview.

Apricot (Prunus armeniaca) is a small tree that grows a fruit that is commonly eaten as food. The fruit, juice, and leaves have also been used as medicine. Apricot is used for asthma, constipation, infertility, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any use.

The Apricot Tree has ovate leaves with an average length of 5-9cm (2-3.5 inches). It blooms during early spring, producing beautiful white-pinkish flowers with five petals, either single or in pairs, that emerge before the tree's foliage in early spring.
