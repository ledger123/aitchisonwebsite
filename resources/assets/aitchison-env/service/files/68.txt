FISH TAIL PALM

The Fishtail Palm was named for its unusual leaves – shaped like a jagged fish's tail – which form thick, swirled layers of ruffled fronds. Fishtails are clustering palms that grow dense and full.

In traditional medicine, Fishtail Palm has been used to treat various ailments. The fruit and the sap of the palm have been used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, and even as a remedy for snake bites. The leaves of Fishtail Palm have been used to make poultices that can treat wounds, burns, and skin irritations.

This clump-growing group of palms has medium green leaf blades which are divided into many segments, each of which resembles the tail of a fancy goldfish. Rarely exceeding 25 feet in height, a number of species of Fishtail Palms produce suckers from the base creating a very attractive specimen palm.
