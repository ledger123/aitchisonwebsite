CONOCARPUS ERECTUS

It is a multi-trunked tree, or shrub with low spreading branches. Its alternate, stalked leaves are oblong to lanceolate in shape, densely-covered by silky hairs and appear silver in colour, 5-10 cm long. Its flowers are inconspicuous, greenish purple-white, free-blooming.

The wood is sometimes used in cabinets; it is difficult to work but takes a smooth finish. It is also used as firewood, and is reported to be good for smoking meat and fish, as it burns very hot and slowly; it also makes high quality charcoal. The bark is high in tannin, for which it has been harvested commercially.

The Green Buttonwood Conocarpus erectus is a great tree for coastal planting. Its high salt and drought tolerances provide a great screen for privacy. Considered a front line tree, the Green Buttonwood is tolerant of extreme exposure to salt spray. It can be used for hedging, as a shade tree, and a specimen plant.
