Roystonea regia, commonly known as the Cuban royal palm or Florida royal palm, is a species of palm native to Mexico, the Caribbean, Florida, and parts of Central America. The royal palm reaches heights from 50 to over 80 feet tall.

It has a religious role both in Santer√≠a and Christianity, where it is used in Palm Sunday observances. It has been planted throughout the tropics and subtropics as an ornamental tree. The seed is used as a source of oil and for livestock feed. Leaves are used for thatching and the wood for construction.

They should be sown into a well-drained, sandy compost at any time of the year, and covered thinly with sand or grit and kept moist. Keep at between 15 and 20 degrees C. Germination usually occurs within 4 to 6 weeks although some seeds may take much longer.
