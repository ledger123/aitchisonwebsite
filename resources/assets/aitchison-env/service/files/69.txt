Ceiba insignis (Chorisia insignis), the white floss-silk tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae, native to dry tropical forests of southern Ecuador and northern Peru.

These are large-leaved trees or shrubs, often dry-season deciduous, some with swollen trunks, others with stout conical prickles on trunk and branches. Leaves are simple or digitately compound. The flowers are showy, open, with 5 red or white petals, and numerous stamens with filaments forming a tube.

Besides the great significance of Bombacaceae plants as ornamentals due to their large branches and brightly coloured flowers, several genera are economically and commercially important, producing timber, edible fruits, vegetable oils or useful fibres, e.g., silk floss trees (Chorisia spp.)
