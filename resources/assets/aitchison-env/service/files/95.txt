Grapefruit 

The botanical name for grapefruit is Citrus paradisi. It is a hybrid of two other citrus species: the pomelo (Citrus maxima) and the sweet orange (Citrus sinensis).

There are several varieties of grapefruit, including white grapefruit, pink grapefruit, and red grapefruit. Pink and red grapefruit varieties get their color from lycopene, a natural pigment.

Grapefruit has a unique flavor profile that is a balance of sweetness and tartness. It is often described as refreshing. The flesh can vary in color from pale yellow to deep pink or red. Grapefruit segments are juicy and typically eaten fresh or used in various culinary dishes and beverages.
