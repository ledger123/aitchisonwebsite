Frangipani

Plumeria, also known as Frangipani, is a genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Rauvolfioideae, of the family Apocynaceae. Most species are deciduous shrubs or small trees. The species variously are endemic to the Neotropical realm but are sometimes grown as cosmopolitan ornamentals in warm regions.

In the language of flowers, Frangipani (Plumeria) carries the symbolic meaning of welcome, support, and wealth in many cultures. In its native range, the flowers were used to symbolize the fertility of deities.

The petals are waxy and the center of the flower is a different color - just like the most common variety which has white flowers with a yellow center. Unlike some flowering trees which bloom for a few days or weeks, frangipani flower for months.
