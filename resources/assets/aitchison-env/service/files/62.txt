PEACH / AAROO / ARU

A low, broad tree, 15 to 25 feet tall with an equal or greater spread, Peach trees form a rounded crown with upwardly-reaching branches clothed in three to six-inch-long, dark green, deciduous leaves.

Peach trees are highly revered in cultures around the world and are known for their blossoms and fruits, but the leaves have also been used medicinally. In China, Peach leaves are boiled as a tea to help reduce symptoms of congestion and coughs and as a kidney cleanser.

The life of a peach tree is about 15 years, and peaches don't bear fruit during the first two years. The trees produce some fruit the third year but bear the most peaches in years 4 to 15. Georgia grows 130 million pounds of peaches each year, but California and South Carolina produce even more.
