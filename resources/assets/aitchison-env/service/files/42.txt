Guava

Various parts of the plant, including the leaf and the fruit, are used as medicine. People use guava leaf for stomach and intestinal conditions, pain, diabetes, and wound healing. The fruit is used for high blood pressure.

Psidium guajava is a large dicotyledonous shrub, or small evergreen tree, generally 3-10 m high, many branches; stems crooked, bark light to reddish brown, thin, smooth, continuously flaking; root system generally superficial and very extensive, frequently extending well beyond the canopy.

The guava tree is indeed a very beautiful ornamental tree with its elegant evergreen foliage and its splendid copper-coloured bark, which comes off in large patches. Its graceful white flowers are adorned with fragrant golden stamens before giving rise to its famous and highly sought-after fruit: guavas.
