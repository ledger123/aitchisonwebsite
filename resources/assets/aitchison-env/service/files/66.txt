LEMON

Lemons trees can produce up to 600 lbs of lemons every year. Lemon trees produce fruit all year round. Lemon zest, grated rinds, is often used in baking. Lemon tree leaves can be used to make tea.

Lemon's glycosides and flavonoids reinforce capillaries and improve circulation. Lemon leaves, rich in limonene and terpene compounds with calming and antispasmodic properties, are also recommended against palpitations, insomnia, headaches and asthma.
