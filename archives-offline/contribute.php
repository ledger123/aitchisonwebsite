                    Our Archives department keeps all available records and displays many of these in the New Archives Centre. The Collection is revised as more material is processed, donated or collected. Great efforts are being made to preserve and conserve our archival material as we are aware of their invaluable significance. We have also started to digitize our archives and aim to continue this process as it is vital for preservation. A vast amount of material exists in our storage such as photographs, records, manuscripts, medals, cups, trophies, letters (typed and hand written), along with various other objects and documents.
