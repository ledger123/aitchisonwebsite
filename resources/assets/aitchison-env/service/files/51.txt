Eucalyptus trees belong to the genus Eucalyptus within the family Myrtaceae. They are characterized by their evergreen leaves, which are often lance-shaped and contain aromatic oil glands. The bark of Eucalyptus trees can vary greatly among species, ranging from smooth and colorful to rough and fibrous.

Eucalyptus trees are primarily native to Australia, where they dominate the landscape. They are often referred to as "Gum Trees" in Australia due to the sticky sap that exudes from damaged bark.

Eucalyptus trees have been introduced and cultivated in many parts of the world with suitable climates, including parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They are valued for their fast growth and adaptability to a variety of soil types.
