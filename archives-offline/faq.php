                    <li><strong>How can I donate my collection?</strong></li>
                    <p class="nopadding">We believe that each collection is invaluable and holds great significance. Please schedule a meeting with our College Archivist to review and discuss the process of donating. You can also email at: <span style="color:#000099;">archivist@aitchison.edu.pk</span></p>
                    <li><strong>How can I share my personal time and experience at Aitchison and be a part of the Oral History segment?</strong></li>
                    <p class="nopadding">We believe that each story and experience is precious. These oral histories are your personal narrations of events and experiences which you have lived at Aitchison College. These take you on a trip down the memory lane and help others to learn about the past. Please email us to schedule an appointment for the interview at: <span style="color:#000099;">archivist@aitchison.edu.pk</span> or call between 8:00 am to 1:00 pm (Mon to Thurs) and 8:00 am to 12:00 pm (Fri to Sat) at: [92 42] 111 363 063 / Ext 431</p>
                    <li><strong>Who will use my collection?</strong></li>
                    <p class="nopadding">Your collection or Oral History Interviews will be safe in our archives. These could be exhibited on our social media page or website. The archives center aims to set up exhibitions from time to time and your collections can be chosen for exhibition displays as well. Your name as the donor of the material will always be mentioned in our records. This material will not be used for profit or marketing purposes but will only be used for the purpose of College’s archive display and research. The records of the archival material given to us in any form will be securely kept in our repository. However, if you don’t want your collection or narration to be displayed or shared with the public, you may inform us accordingly.</p>
                    <li><strong>Can I donate copies and keep my originals?</strong></li>
                    <p class="nopadding">We prefer to collect original records and materials rather than copies. It is preferred to use originals both for the purpose of readability of the document and for the proof of authenticity. We will provide to <strong>donors</strong>, free of charge, photocopies of any collection donated. In exceptional cases, the Archives will accept high-quality copies of very significant materials should a donor be unable to donate the originals.</p>
